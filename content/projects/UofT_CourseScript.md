## Description
***IT'S A FREE WEAPON FOR EVERYONE, USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!***\
UofT Course Script is a fully free open-source script written in Python with [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) (automating web applications) to help UofT students get popular courses securely. https://github.com/Svision/UofT_CourseScript

## Motivation
There are already some agents who charge students to 'help' them get popular courses, and students usually need to provide their username and password.
This behavior is not only very unsecure to themselves but also unfair for other students.

## Purpose
***This script is intended solely to provide a more fair and secure environment for UofT students' course enrollment.***

## ATTENTION
***NOT INTENDED FOR ANY COMMERCIAL USE***
> Using the scirpt might result your Utorid Account be blocked by admin!

## Future Work
- ~~Bypass reCAPTCHA~~
- ~~Specify Course timeslot~~
- Multiple Courses support
